Setup the TFTP Server

Download and install a TFTP Application (Such as Solarwinds, TFTpd64, etc)

On Solarwinds
- Select 'File' > 'Configure'
    Under the 'General Tab', take note of the Storage > TFTP Server Root Directory.
      This is where the server will contain their files.

    Then, go to 'Server Bindings' Tab
      On the 'Currently Available Addresses', select the IP address of the PC (10.72.1.10)
      It must appear on the Server Binding Section.

- Finally, Select 'OK'

Now our tftp server is running and operational. (Make sure to not close the app)


******
Upload the device image to the TFTP Server

Connect to the switch using a serial and telnet connection

On the telnet session, enter the following commands:

@Switch
archive upload-sw tftp://10.72.1.10/c3560-ipservicesk9-mz.150-2.SE9.bin

*Possible Errors: 
 - Make sure to assign a filename on the specified path. Otherwise you will encounter an "Illegal Operaton Error"
 - Have a TFTP server running on the PC (SolarWinds, TFTPD64, etc.)
     - TFTP uses port 69.
     - Bind the IP address of your device as a TFTP Server IP
