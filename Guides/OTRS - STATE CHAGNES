## ITSM Change Process

### STEP 1 - User reports an issue to [Tier 1 NOC] with the internet slowing down

__Ticket__
- Type: Incident
- To: [NOC] Tier 1 - Monitoring & First Response
- Service: [NOC] Infrastructure & Application Monitoring
- SLA: Performance Management SLA
- Subject: Network Issue
- Priority: 4 High
  
- Text: 
~~~
The network is very slow, and we are unable to reliably connect to services such as servers and printers. 
Additionally, IP phone extensions/numbers are disappearing intermittently. 
This is impacting our ability to make and receive calls.

Hi user1,

Thank you for reporting this issue.

We are currently investigating the network performance problems and the IP phone registration issue. 
Initial checks show possible network congestion or a connectivity disruption affecting multiple services.

Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this.

Best regards,
IT Support Team

Issue summary:
  Network extremely slow
  Cannot access servers and printers
  IP phones losing registration
  Multiple users affected

Troubleshooting performed by Tier 1:
  Verified issue affects multiple users
  Confirmed both wired/wireless impacted
  Restarted affected workstation(s)
  Verified no local NIC errors
  Basic connectivity tests failed/intermittent

Reason for escalation:
  Issue appears to be infrastructure-related (core switch / firewall / VoIP system). 
  Requires Tier 2 investigation.

Hi user1,

Your ticket has been escalated to our Tier 2 Network Team for further investigation. 
They are currently reviewing the infrastructure components involved.

We will provide updates as soon as more information is available.

Thank you for your patience.

### STEP 3 - Create an ITSM Change with a Work Order for Change [Request] Creation 

__ITSM Change__
- Title: Implement Port Security on Access Switches to Prevent MAC Flooding
- Description: 
~~~
Network is currently slow caused by a traffic congestion from CoreSwitches
CoreSwitches consuming high CPU usage caused by a flood of MAC Addresses.
Switches are currently lacking proper security implementations to prevent L2 attacks.
~~~

<br>

- Justification:
~~~
CPU 99%
~~~

<br>

- Category: 4 High
- Impact: 4 High
- Priority: 4 High


<br>
<br>


__WorkOrder [REQUEST]__
- Title: Change Request Creation
- Workorder Type: Approval
- Planned Time: +1 Day
- Description:  
~~~
Users reported slow connectivity. Investigation identified high CPU utilization on Cisco access switch due to MAC address table flooding. The switch is vulnerable to MAC flooding attack.
Requesting change approval to implement port security configuration on affected access ports.


Reason for Change:
  Mitigate network traffic congestion.
  Prevent recurrence of MAC flooding attack.
  Improve switch stability.
  Enhance Layer 2 security posture.


Proposed Solution:
  Enable port security.
  Limit MAC addresses per port.
  Enable violation restrict/shutdown mode.
  Enable sticky MAC where applicable.

### STEP 4 - Create a Work Order for [Impact Analysis] & Plan Assessment

ITIL-Based Impact Analysis Framework
- Identify the Scope of the Change - Determine affected users, services, network, hardware, etc
- Identify Stakeholders - Who are involved in managing the change
- Assess Impact Levels - Structured Categories
- Identify Risks - Document mitigation and rollback plans.
- Analyze Dependencies - Map related systems and processes
- Document Findings - Summary of scope, stakeholders, risks, impact, and dependencies
- Decision Support - CAB approval, Scheduling


<br>


__WorkOrder [IMPACT ANALYSIS]__
- Title: Technical & Risk Assestment / Action Plan
- Workorder Type: Approval
- Planned Time: +1 Day
- Description:
~~~
Technical Analysis
Enabling port security may:
  Temporarily disrupt connected devices
  Cause port shutdown if misconfigured
  Requires maintenance window
  Minimal downtime expected (per access port configuration)
  
  
Risk Assessment:
Risk	            Likelihood	   Impact	Mitigation
Port shutdown	    Medium	       Medium	Configure restrict mode first
User disconnection	Low	Low	       Change   during maintenance window
Misconfiguration	Low	Medium	   Peer     review config


Impact Scope
Affected Devices:
Cisco Access Switch SW-ACC-01
SW-ACC-02


Affected Users:
Office Floor 2 (~45 users)
No impact to core or WAN


Backout Plan
!@Switch
conf t
 int range fa0/1-12
  no switchport port-security
  shut
  no shut
  end
~~~


<br>
<br>


### STEP 5 - Create a Work Order for [Approval/Denial]
CAB (Change Advisory Board) Members:
- Network Manager
- IT Operations Lead
- Security Officer

<br>

__Work Order [APPROVAL/DENIAL]__
- Title:  CAB Review Approval/Denial
- Workorder Type: Decision
- Planned Time: +1 Day
- Description:
~~~
Approval Considerations
- Minimal downtime
- Security Imporvement
- Backout Plan

Decision:
 Proposed Maintenance Window
 Schedule: 22:00 - 23:30
~~~


<br>
<br>


### STEP 6 - Create a Work Order for [Implementation]

__Work Order [IMPLEMENTATION]__
Title: Implementation Procedure 
- Workorder Type: Workorder
- Planned Time: +1 Day
- Description:
~~~
Pre-implementation Tasks:
Backup Configs:

!@Cisco
copy run start
copy run ftp:

- Save external backup to TFTP
- Notify users of maintenance window
- Confirm monitoring alerts configured

Implementation:
!@Cisco
conf t
interface range fa0/6,fa0/8
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 1
 switchport port-security violation restrict
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
end
 
 
Post Implementation
- CPU utilization normalized
- MAC address table state
- No unexpected port shutdowns
- Users confirmed stable connectivity [Ticket Reply]
~~~


<br>
<br>


### STEP 7 - Create a Work Order for Post Implementation Review PIR [Report]

__Work Order [REPORT/REVIEW]__
Title: PIR Incident Report
- Workorder Type: PIR
- Planned Time: +1 Day
- Description:
~~~
Review Date: 3 days - 1 week after change

Port security was configured on the core switches to improve network security by limiting MAC addresses per port and preventing unauthorized device connections.
The objective was to enhance network access control and reduce the risk of rogue devices.

Observations
- CPU usage reduced from 85% → 18%
- No further MAC flooding detected
- No user complaints
- Port violations logged correctly

Lessons Learned
- Port security was not enabled by default
- Access switches lacked L2 security hardening baseline
- Need standard switch hardening template


Idealy Performed with RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
