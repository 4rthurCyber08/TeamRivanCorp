Solution:

1. Etherchannel
	-Configure L2 Etherchannel on links between SW1, SW2, & SW3 with the following settings:
		- SW1 must actively negotiate the IEEE standard protocol to SW2
		- SW2 must passively negotiate the IEEE standard protocol to SW1
		- SW2 & SW3 must both actively negotiate the Cisco Proprietary protocol to each other.
		- Make sure to use the correct Port Channel number as specified in the topology.

@SW1
conf t
 int range fa0/2-3
	!- SW1 must actively negotiate the IEEE standard protocol to SW2
	!- Make sure to use the correct Port Channel number as specified in the topology.
  channel-group 12 mode active
  channel-protocol lacp
  no shut
  end

@SW2
conf t
 int range fa0/2-3
	!- SW1 must actively negotiate the IEEE standard protocol to SW2
	!- Make sure to use the correct Port Channel number as specified in the topology.
  channel-group 12 mode passive
  channel-protocol lacp
  no shut 
  end

@SW2 & SW3
conf t
 int range fa0/4-5
	!- SW2 & SW3 must both actively negotiate the Cisco Proprietary protocol to each other.
	!- Make sure to use the correct Port Channel number as specified in the topology.
  channel-group 45 mode desirable
  channel-protocol pagp
  no shut
  end


2. Trunk
		-Trunk the links between SW1, SW2, & SW3 using the standard trunking protocol with the following settings.
			- Make sure to allow only the necessary VLAN/s for each link.
			- Set the native VLAN to VLAN 'Main'
		
We can do this in 2 ways:
	-Apply trunk configurations from the 'int range command' or apply them from the 'portchannel'. 
	This is because any configs applied to the portchannel will also be applied to the interfaces that belong to the specified portchannel.
		-For this solution we will apply configs to the portchannel.

@SW1 & SW2
conf t
 int po12
	!-Trunk the links between SW1, SW2, & SW3 using the standard trunking protocol: dot1q (802.1q)
  sw tr encaps dot1q
	!- Make sure to allow only the necessary VLAN/s for each link.
  sw tr allowed vlan 10,20
	!- Set the native VLAN to VLAN 'Main'. If you don't know the vlan number of main, use a 'show vlan brief' command
  sw tr native vlan 69
  sw mo tr
  end

@SW2 & SW3
conf t
 int po45
  sw tr encaps dot1q
	!- Make sure to allow only the necessary VLAN/s for each link.
  sw tr allowed vlan 10,20,100
  sw tr native vlan 69
  sw mo tr
  end

3. VTP
	-Configure SW1 as a vtp server with a domain name: CCNA.
		Set the VTP version to: 2
		Set the VTP password to: s3cr3t
			
	-Configure SW2 & SW3 as a vtp client under the same domain as SW1
	

@SW1
conf t
	!-Configure SW1 as a vtp server with a domain name: CCNA.
 vtp domain CCNA
 vtp version 2
 vtp mode server
 
	!Set the VTP password to: s3cr3t
 vtp pass s3cr3t
 
	!Set the VTP version to: 2
 end

@SW2 & SW3
conf t
	!-Configure SW2 & SW3 as a vtp client under the same domain as SW1
 vtp domain CCNA
 vtp version 2
 vtp mode client
 vtp pass s3cr3t
 end

Verify: 'sh vtp status'

4. VLANs
	-Create the following VLANs on SW1
		Voice: 100
		Admin: 10
		Main: 69
		Finance: 20
		Guest: 200
	-Apply the IP addresses of each VLANs for all switches as specified in the topology.

@SW1
conf t
	!-Create the following VLANs on SW1
 vlan 100
  name Voice
 vlan 10
  name Admin
 vlan 69
  name Main
 vlan 20
  name Finance
 vlan 200
  name Guest

Verify: 'sh vlan br'

@SW1
conf t
	!-Apply the IP addresses of each VLANs for all switches as specified in the topology.

  ip add 10.0.200.3 255.255.255.240
  no shut
  end
  
Verify: 'sh ip int br | ex una'
  
5. Switchport Access/Voice
		-On all switches, assign each end device to their correct VLANs as specified in the topology.

@SW1
conf t
 int fa0/1
  sw mo ac
  sw ac vlan 10
  end
  
@SW2
conf t
 int fa0/1
  sw mode access
  sw access vlan 20
  sw voice vlan 100
  end
  
@SW3
conf t
 int fa0/1
  sw mo ac
  sw ac vlan 10
 !-use a range command since PC4 & S2 are part of the same VLAN
 int range fa0/2-3
  sw mo ac
  sw ac vlan 20


6. DHCP
	-Configure SW3 as a DHCP server for Finance with the following settings:
		-Exclude the first 100 ips of the network.
		-DHCP pool name: FinancePool
		-Network: 10.0.20.0 255.255.255.0
		-Default Gateway: 10.0.20.3
		-Domain Name: ccnaFin.com
	
	-Configure SW3 as a DHCP server for Voice with the following settings:
		-Exclude the first 50 ips of the network
		-DHCP pool name: VoPool
		-Network: 10.0.100.0 255.255.255.0
		-Default Gateway: 10.0.100.1
		-Domain Name: ccnaVo.com
		
		-Add DHCP service for PC2 & PC4 in order for them to obtain an IP.

@SW3
conf t
	!-Exclude the first 100 ips of the network.
 ip dhcp excluded-address 10.0.20.1 10.0.20.100
	!-Exclude the first 50 ips of the network
 ip dhcp excluded-address 10.0.100.1 10.0.100.50
	!-Configure SW3 as a DHCP server for Finance
 ip dhcp pool FinancePool
  network 10.0.20.0 255.255.255.0
  default-router 10.0.20.3
  domain-name ccnaFin.com
	!-Configure SW3 as a DHCP server for Voice
 ip dhcp pool VoPool
  network 10.0.100.0 255.255.255.0
  default-router 10.0.100.1
  domain-name ccnaVo.com
  end

@PC2 & PC4
In order to add IPs via dhcp to PCs, 
	select the PC
	click on the 'desktop' tab
	choose 'command prompt'
	type the command:
		ipconfig /renew

Verify: @SW3 'sh ip dhcp bindings'

	@IP Phone: If you click on the IP Phone then GUI tab. It should say 'Configuring CM List'
		This implies it has a vlan and an ip address. 
		Verify the ip address on SW3 and excecuting the command 'sh ip dhcp binding'
