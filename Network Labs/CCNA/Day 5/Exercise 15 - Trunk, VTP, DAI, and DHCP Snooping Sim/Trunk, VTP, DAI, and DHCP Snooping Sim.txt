INSTRUCTIONS

Refer to the topology. 
All physical cabling is in place. Routers R3 and R4 have the necessary configurations and are inaccessible.

1. R5 fails to form neighborships and adjacancies with other OSPF routers. Resolve these issues only from R5 and R6.
	- R4 is trying to form a point-to-point network with R5.
	- R3 and R6 are not advertising routes or forming a neighborship with R5.

2. Set a default route on R2 with R3 as the primary gateway and R4 as the secondary.

3. R1 is unable to reach R6. Troubleshoot this issue from R1 and R2.

SOLUTION

1. R5 fails to form neighborships and adjacancies with other OSPF routers. Resolve these issues only from R5.
	- R4 is trying to form a point-to-point network with R5.
	
@R5
conf t
 int e0/2
  ip ospf network point-to-point
  end

Verify: Use the "show ip ospf neighbor" command on R5. R4 must be in the Full state.

	- R3 and R6 are not advertising routes or forming a neighborship with R5

The requirements to form a neighborship between ospf routers are as follows:
	Same Area ID
	Same Area type
	Same Subnet Mask
	Same Hello and Dead timers
	Same Authentication
	They see their own OSPF RID in each other's Hello packet

Use various show commands to determine the cause of the issue.

@R5, R6
show ip protocols - check the router ID, area ID & the advertised networks (Area ID, Subnet Mask, Network)
show ip ospf database - check LSA information
show ip ospf neigh - check neighboring router's states.
show ip ospf int - check process ID, network type, and hello & dead timer intervals.
show ip int brief - check if port are UP/DOWN or are configured with proper IP.

Through the show command "show ip protocols" we discover that R5 advertised the correct network (10.3.35.0 /29) but assigned the wrong area ID.
We must resolve the issue by removing the wrong configuration then replacing it with the correct one.

@R5
conf t
 router ospf 1
  no network 10.3.35.0 0.0.0.7 area 2
  network 10.3.35.0 0.0.0.7 area 0

When it comes to R6, the "show ip ospf int" command shows us that the hello and dead intervals between R5 & R6 do not match.
There's no specification what interval to use, so simply set the interval to default.

@R5, R6
conf t
 int e0/0
  ip ospf hello-interval 10
  ip ospf dead-interval 40
  end

Verify: Use the "show ip ospf neighbor" command once more on R5 and make sure that R3, R4, and R6 are present and are in FULL state while R4 is point-to-point (-)

2. Set a default route on R2 with R3 as the primary gateway and R4 as the secondary.

We don't know R3 or R4's IPs on their e0/1 interface, and the command "show cdp neigh" does not reveal R3 or R4. 
This simply means CDP is disable for R3 & R4.

The only option left to configure R3 & R4 as the default gateway is by specifying an interface instead of a next-hop.

@R2
conf t
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 e0/1 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 e0/2 2
 end

Verify: Use ping on R2 destined for any IP within the OSPF area.

3. R1 is unable to reach R6. Troubleshoot this issue from R1 and R2.

When it comes to reachability, check the routing table first.

@R1
show ip route

Check if R1 has any route for R6's IP. If not, make sure R1 has a default route configured.
From the show command, its clear the R1 has neither routing nor default gateway. Simply configure R2 as the gateway for R1 since R2 can reach R6.

Use the show ip int brief command on R2 to check its IP on its e0/0 interface to be used as the gateway for R1.

@R1
conf t
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.12.2
 end

Verify: From R1 ping R6. Ping must be successful.
