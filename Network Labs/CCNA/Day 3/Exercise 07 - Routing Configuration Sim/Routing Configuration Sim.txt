For Accessing Devices

 Device 	Port
 P1 	 	2091
 S1 	 	2092
 R1 	 	2093
 R3 	 	2095



TASKS
 IPv4 addressing is preconfigured. You are instructed to configure routes between devices so that P1 will be able to reach both S1 and Google.

*NOTE: R2 and R4 are inaccessible.

1. Configure a static host route on R1 destined for Google.
    - The link between both R1 and R2's e0/1 interface must be primary.
    - The link between both R1 and R2's e0/2 interface must be secondary.
    - The distance metric for the secondary route must be 2 units higher than OSPF's default administrative distance.

2. Configure a static route on R1 destined for S1.
    - R1 must prefer R3 to reach S1 through the use of a host route.

3. Configure a default and static route on R3 destined for Google, S1, and P1.
    - Set a default route on R3, with R1 as the gateway.
    - Configure a static route on R3 where packets destined for S1 must go through R4.

4. Configure a default route on P1.


SOLUTION

 1. Configure a static route on R1 destined for Google.
    - The link between both R1 and R2's e0/1 interface must be primary.
    - The link between both R1 and R2's e0/2 interface must be secondary.
    - The distance metric for the secondary route must be 2 units higher than OSPF's default administrative distance.

Since R2 is inaccessible and we do not know its ips on any of its ports we will not be able to specify a next-hop.
In order to achieve this task, we have two options:
    A. Use Cisco Discovery Protocol to identify the IP of the connected device.
    b. Specify an interface rather than a next-hop.

For option A, this can only be achieved if CDP is enabled on both devices (R1 & R2).

@R1
conf t
 show cdp entry R2


We find that R2's IPs on its e0/1 interface is 10.12.1.2 while on its e0/2 interface is 10.12.2.2.
We then use this information as the next-hop for the static route.

@R1
conf t
 ip route 142.251.220.238 255.255.255.255 10.12.1.2
 ip route 142.251.220.238 255.255.255.255 10.12.2.2 112
 !--use 112 as the administrative distance since OSPF has a default AD of 110, then increase it by 2 as specified on the instruction.


For option B.

@R1
conf t
 ip route 142.251.220.238 255.255.255.255 e0/1
 ip route 142.251.220.238 255.255.255.255 e0/2 112
 !--use 112 as the administrative distance since OSPF has a default AD of 110, then increase it by 2 as specified on the instruction.


Either option is valid.


2. Configure a static route on R1 destined for S1.
    - R1 must prefer R3 to reach S1 through the use of a host route.

Since we have access to R3, use the "show ip int brief" command on R3 to identify its IP address.

@R1
conf t
 ip route 10.1.41.1 255.255.255.255 10.13.1.3

*NOTE: R1 will still not be able to ping S1 because the next hop (R3) still doesn't know how to ping S1. complete the next task so that R1 can ping S1.

3. Configure a default and static route on R3 destined for Google, S1, and P1.
    - Set a default route on R3, with R1 as the gateway.

@R3
conf t
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.13.1.1


    - Configure a static route on R3 where, packets destined for S1 must go through R4.

@R3
conf t
 ip route 10.1.41.1 255.255.255.255 e0/1



4. Configure a default route on P1.

@P1
conf t
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.12.2
