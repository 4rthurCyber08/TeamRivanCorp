PRECAUTION

Before starting this sim, if you are going to use your Day_1.txt file with all the script filled in with your monitor number, it is a good idea to create a copy as a backup.
You will need to make changes to your script because of the limitations of this sim. (Please refer to the LIMITATIONS section.)


SCENARIO

    You are seated on monitor 81 and are instructed to configure Day 1 setup.
        Cabling is completed.
        The student seated at monitor 92 has finished configurations and can ping other student's PC other than your own.


GOAL

    Your PC must be able to ping PC92
    IP addresses on the topology should be assigned to the following end device via DHCP configured on CoreBABA:
        Camera 6 (C6) = 10.81.50.6
        Camera 8 (C8) = 10.81.50.8
        ePhone 1 (eP1) = 10.81.100.101
        ePhone 2 (eP2) = 10.81.100.102


LIMITATIONS

	Unlike real devices, devices in this sim have significant differences,

	Such as:

		All ports are Ethernet and have a different port number. (Please refer to the topology)
		VTY Lines are limited to 5.

			Make sure to issue the 'line vty 0 4' command instead of 'line vty 0 15'

		End devices (camera & ephones) behave differently.
			- ePhones can automatically receive IP addresses via DHCP but are unable to be pinged. This is caused by a conflict between voice and data traffic.
			- Cameras can automatically receive IP addresses via DHCP but will only accept one IP until the end of its DHCP lease.
			- This means if they receive an IP from the VLAN 50 DHCP pool before you could configure IP reservation, you will have to manually issue an 'ip add dhcp' command on the cameras e0/0 interface for the reservation to take effect.
			- On the Call Manager, there is only 1 command that won't be accepted, "port 0/0/0" under the dial-peer option. Everything else works, including IVRS.

	Despite the limitations, all configurations necessary for CCNA is available for this sim (IP assignment, VLANs, DHCP, switchport, and static & default route).


	*NOTE
		Do not remove the access-list on CoreBABA. It is configured to prevent issues with DHCP on end devices.

end


TIP: Add the 'do' keyword to show commands when in configuration mode.
###




###### TRUNK & ETHERCHANNEL

Use the 'show cdp neighbor' command to identify a device's connected port to another device.

*NOTE: On the "show cdp neighbor table", under the 2nd column "Local interface" that is the interface of the device you are currently accessing.

@CoreTAAS & CoreBABA
show cdp neighbor


After using the 'show cdp neighbor' command on either CoreBABA or CoreTAAS
we discover that their connected ports are: e0/3, e1/3, e2/3

@CoreTAAS & CoreBABA
config t
 Int Range e0/3,e1/3,e2/3
  no shutdown
  switchport trunk encapsulation Dot1Q
  switchport mode trunk
 end

@CoreTAAS & CoreBABA
config t
 Int Range e0/3,e1/3,e2/3
  channel-group 1 mode active
  channel-protocol Lacp


Verification:

  show etherchannel summary


The port-channel 1 (Po1) must be tagged with 'SU', which means the port-channel is layer 2 and is in use, working properly.
###



###### DHCP

@CoreBABA
config t
 ip dhcp Excluded-add 10.81.1.1 10.81.1.100
 ip dhcp Excluded-add 10.81.10.1 10.81.10.100

  end


###



###### VLAN Creation and Switchport Access & Voice

*NOTE: The command 'mls qos trust device cisco-phone' does not work on this sim.

@CoreBABA
config t
 vlan 10
  name WIFIVLAN
 vlan 50
  name IPCCTVLAN
 vlan 69
  name PENTEST
 vlan 70
  name BLUETEAMSOC

  name HR-FUUUUU
 vlan 100
  name VOICEVLAN
 Int e0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10  
 Int e0/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
 Int e2/1

  switchport access vlan 50  
 Int e2/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 50    
 Int e1/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 100     
 Int e1/1
  switchport mode access  
  switchport voice vlan 100
!--simply add an exclamation mark at the front of the command for it to be ignored by the device.
  !mls qos trust device cisco-phone 
  switchport access vlan 1
 Int e1/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport voice vlan 100 
  !mls qos trust device cisco-phone 
  switchport access vlan 1
 end


Verification:
show vlan brief
show ip dhcp binding


*NOTE: At this point, both ePhones & Cameras should be able to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
It will take some time so be patient. Use the 'show ip dhcp binding' command to verify.
    ePhones must have an IP of 10.81.100.101 and 10.81.100.102
    Cameras will end up with an IP of 10.81.50.101 and 10.81.50.102

HOWEVER this should not be the case. Because we are meant to apply IP reservation. See next task to fix the issue.

TIP: Most switchports are set as access ports by default and are connected to VLAN 1
###



###### DHCP MAC Address Reservation

First, we need to identify the MAC address of the cameras. Issue a 'show mac address-table' command on the switch (CoreBABA).

@CoreBABA
show mac address-table

From the topology, we know that CoreBABA is connected to Camera 8 from its e2/1 interface, while Camera 6 is on CoreBABA's e2/2 interface.

On the MAC address table: 

    Ethernet 2/1 is associated with a MAC: a800.b00b.4cb2
    Ethernet 2/2 is associated with a MAC: a600.b0b0.38af

Using these MAC address we can configure IP reservation for the devices.

@CoreBABA
config t
 ip routing
 ip dhcp pool CAMERA6
  host 10.81.50.6 255.255.255.0
  !--The client-identifier command might fail if C6 & C8 already recieved an IP from the IPCCTV DHCP pool.
  !--To resolve this apply the 'clear ip dhcp binding *' command to coreBABA, then paste the reservation commands again.
  client-identifier a600.b0b0.38af
 ip dhcp pool CAMERA8
  host 10.81.50.8 255.255.255.0
  client-identifier a800.b00b.4cb2
end


Verification:
show ip dhcp binding

*NOTE: Clearing the DHCP Binding table does not remove the IP addresses on the Cameras. To resolve this, access both Camera's CLI
then issue an 'ip add dhcp' command on its ethernet 0/0 interface.

@C6 & C8
conf t
 int e0/0
  ip add dhcp
  end


Verification:
show ip interface brief


###



###### CUCM: IPv4 address assignment & SVI

*NOTE: The "port 0/0/0" command under dial-peer does not work because there are no voice-port for this sim.

@CUCM
config t
 hostname CUCM-81
 enable secret pass
 service password-encryption
 no logging console
 no ip domain-lookup
 line console 0
  password pass
  login
  exec-timeout 0 0
 line vty 0 4
  password pass
  login
  exec-timeout 0 0
 Int e0/0
  no shutdown
  ip add 10.81.100.8 255.255.255.0 
  end

###### EDGE, CoreBABA, CUCM: Static, Default, & OSPF Routing

Depending on what is taught on Day 1, issue either static routing or OSPF.
Either one will work for this sim.


### STATIC ROUTING

@EDGE

Verification:
    show ip ospf neighbor

@CoreBABA
show ip ospf neighbor
!CoreBABA must have CUCM(10.81.100.8) & EDGE(81.0.0.1) displayed.


###



FINALIZE

    PC must be able to ping PC92 (@PC: ping 10.92.1.10 or traceroute 10.92.1.10)
    End devices are part of the correct vlan (@CoreBABA: show vlan brief)
    The following end devices must have corresponding IPs:
        eP1: 10.81.100.101
        eP2: 10.81.100.102
        c6: 10.81.50.6
        c8: 10.81.50.8

        Use the "show ip int brief" command on the end devices to verify.

given the DHCP server (coreBABA) is configured properly.
 
 
    HOWEVER, it will not display its ip address on any interface.
    
Use the 'show ip dhcp binding' command on the switch (CoreBABA) 
to identify if the ePhones recieved an IP.
 
Expected IPs: 
 
ePhones must have an IP from the
 
10.81.100.100 - 10.81.100.254 range.
