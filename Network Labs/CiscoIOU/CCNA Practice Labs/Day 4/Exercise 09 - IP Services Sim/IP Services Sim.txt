TASKS
Cables are in place and IP addressing  is preconfigured. Do not remove any routing configurations or loopback IPs.

1. Configure NAT on R2.
    - Create a standard access-list named NAT, to permit ONLY Class A, B, and C private IPv4 addresses to be translated to R2's e0/0 ip address and gain access to I1.


2. Configure I1 as an NTP server with the lowest stratum value, and R2 as its client using I1's loopback 8 IP. Then set the NTP server's clock to Midnight on Jan 1, 2019.


3. Configure R2 as an NTP server with a stratum value of 2, then, configure R1 as a client, not a peer, using the IP address of R2's e0/2 interface.


4. Configure an account on R1 with the following:
    - Username: ccnadmin
    - Password: s3cr3t
    - With privilege level access
    - The password must be hashed with MD5


5. Configure an account on R2 with the following:
    - Username: N3t4ccess
    - Password: h1dden
    - With privilege level access
    - The password must be hashed with Scrypt


6. Configure SSH2 connectivity on R1, only allowing SSH for remote connections. Access for user ccnadmin must be set on the router using RSA with 1024 bits.


7. Configure Telnet and SSH2 connectivity on R2, excluding other remote connections. Access for user N3t4ccess must be set on the router using RSA with 2048 bits.


8. (On the topic of networking) Configure the hostnames for the routers:
    - Set R1's hostname to the full form of R from RSA.
    - Set R2's hostname to the full form of S from RSA.
    - Set R3's hostname to the full form of A from RSA.


SOLUTION

1. Configure NAT on R2.
    - Create a standard access-list named NAT, to permit ONLY Class A, B, and C private IPv4 addresses to be translated to R2's e0/0 ip address and have all inside devices gain access to I1.

@R2
conf t
 ip access-list standard NAT
  permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
  permit 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255
  permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
  exit
 int range e0/1-2
  ip nat inside
 int e0/0
  ip nat outside
 ip nat inside source list NAT int e0/0 overload

Verification: Ping 8.8.8.8 on R1. Ping must be successful.

Then, ping again with a source IP of its loopback. Ping must fail.

 @R1
ping 8.8.8.8
!- ping must be successful
!
ping 8.8.8.8 source 1.1.1.1
!- ping must fail because the source IP is not permitted by the NAT access-list.


2. Configure I1 as an NTP server with the lowest stratum value, and R2 as its client using I1's loopback 8 IP. Then set the NTP server's clock to Midnight on Jan 1, 2019.

@I1
conf t
 ntp master 1
 ntp source loopback 8
 exit
clock set 00:00:00 January 1 2019

@R2
conf t
 ntp server 8.8.8.8

*NOTE: NTP Synchronization might take a while.


3. Configure R2 as an NTP server with a stratum value of 2, then, configure R1 as a client, not a peer, using the IP address of R2's e0/2 interface.

@R2
conf t
 ntp master 2
 ntp source e0/2

@R1
conf t
 ntp server 172.16.22.2


4. Configure an account on R1 with the following:
    - Username: ccnadmin
    - Password: s3cr3t
    - With privilege level access
    - The password must be hashed with MD5

@R1
conf t
 username ccnadmin privilege 15 secret s3cr3t 
 ! ---secret already uses MD5 hash by default so no need to specify algorithm-type


5. Configure an account on R2 with the following:
    - Username: N3t4ccess
    - Password: h1dden
    - With privilege level access
    - The password must be hashed with Scrypt

@R2
conf t
 username N3t4ccess privilege 15 algorithm-type scrypt secret h1dden


6. Configure SSH2 connectivity on R1, only allowing SSH for remote connections. Access for user ccnadmin must be set on the router using RSA with 1024 bits.

*NOTE: When configuring SSH it is important to remember the prerequisites:
    To configure SSH, you need the following:
    - None default hostname (hostname must not be router or switch depending on the device).
    - A domain name
    - A local user account
    - Remote access
    - Generate RSA key pair

On R1, use the "show ip domain-name" command to check if a domain name is configure.
We find that there is already a preconfigured domain name so we can skip that requirement.

@R1
conf t
 crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
 ip ssh version 2
 line vty 0 4
  transport input ssh
  login local
  end


*NOTE: the crypto key command can also be "crypto key generate rsa" where we omit the modulus. If we do this, the CLI will ask about the size of the modulus.

Both commands achieve the same thing. One is just configure in a single line while the other has a follow-up question

Additionally, the vty lines (line vty 0 4) may vary. To check the number of vty lines of a devices, use the show run command and check the very last part.

Most devices have a total of 16 vty line and more (line vty 0 15). Older devices and some simulations like packet tracer and Cisco IOU web can only have 5 (line vty 0 4)


7. Configure Telnet and SSH connectivity on R2, excluding other remote connections. Access for user N3t4ccess must be set on the router using RSA with 2048 bits.

Use the "show ip domain-name" to check if there's one configured.

We find that there is no domain name and since it was not specified simply configure one.

@R2
conf t
 ip domain-name ccna.com
 crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
 ip ssh version 2
 line vty 0 4
  transport input ssh telnet
  login local
  end


8. (On the topic of networking) Configure the hostnames for the routers:
    - Set R1's hostname to the full form of R from RSA.
    - Set R2's hostname to the full form of S from RSA.
    - Set R3's hostname to the full form of A from RSA.

@R1
conf t
 hostname Rivest

@R2
conf t
 hostname Shamir

@R3
conf t
 hostname Adleman
