TASKS

Refer to the topology.

All physical cabling is in place. Core and Distribution Switches have connectivity and are configured with trunk links between each other.
C1 is inaccessible and is configured to form an etherchannel.


Interface Connection
	 e0/1 	 e0/1 	
C1 Interfaces 	 e0/2 	 e0/2 	C2 Interfaces

	 e0/3 	 e0/3
	

Interface Connection
	 e0/0 	 e0/0 	
C1 Interfaces 	 e1/0 	 e1/0 	D1 Interfaces


Interface Connection
	 e1/1 	 e1/1 	
C1 Interfaces 	 e1/2 	 e1/2 	D2 Interfaces


2. Configure etherchannel on the link between C2 & D1:
    - C2 must negotiate forming the IEEE standard for link aggregation.
    - D1 must not negotiate but will form the IEEE standard for link aggregation.

3. Configure etherchannel on the link between C2 & D2:
    - both C2 & D2 must negotiate forming the IEEE standard for link aggregation.

4. For STP,
    - Configure C2 as the primary root bridge for vlan SECURITY, CCTV, and VOICE.
    - Configure C2 as the secondary root bridge for vlan ADMIN, HR, FINANCE.

5. Configure Uplinkfast for all Access switches.

6. Enable LLDP on D1, D2, and A3.
    - On the interface of both D1 & D2 that connects to A3, configure the interfaces to not send CDP packets, and only recieve LLDP packets.
    - On both interface of A3 that is connected to D1 & D2, configure the interfaces to not send CDP packets, and send lldp packets but not recieve.

SOLUTION

1. C1 is trying to passively form a LACP etherchannel with C2, D1, & D2.
Complete the configuration on C2, D1, & D2 so that port-channel 2,11, & 12 are layer 2 and in-use. 

We can't use the "show cdp neighbors" command to identify connected ports with C1 because when an etherchannel fails to form the vlans will go down, thus the trunk links will also go down, preventing CDP packets from being transmitted to connected links.
Refer to the given table for connected ports.

Since it is specified that C1 is PASSIVELY forming a LACP etherchannel we need to make sure the configuration on the connected device has a mode of ACTIVE.

@C2
conf t
 int range e0/1-3
  channel-group 12 mode active
  channel-protocol LACP
  end

@D1
conf t
 int range e0/0,e1/0
  channel-group 11 mode active
  channel-protocol LACP
  end

@D2
conf t
 int range e1/1-2
  channel-group 2 mode active
  channel-protocol LACP
  end


Verification: Use the "show etherchannel summary" command on C2, D2, & D1 and make sure the appropriate Port-Channel has a tag of SU.


2. Configure etherchannel on the link between C2 & D1:
    - C2 must negotiate forming the IEEE standard for link aggregation.
    - D1 must not negotiate but will form the IEEE standard for link aggregation.


The IEEE standard for link aggregation is simply LACP.
C2 must negotiate implies that it must be set to ACTIVE mode.
D1 must not negotiate but will form an etherchannel implies that it must be set to PASSIVE mode.

Remember to use the "show cdp neighbor" command to easily identify connected ports.

@C2
conf t
 int range e1/1-2
  channel-group 1 mode active
  channel-protocol LACP

@D1
conf t
 int range e1/1-2
  channel-group 1 mode passive
  channel-protocol LACP


3. Configure etherchannel on the link between C2 & D2:
    - both C2 & D2 must negotiate forming the IEEE standard for link aggregation.

@C2, D2
conf t
 int range e0/0,e1/0
  channel-group 22 mode active
  channel-protocol LACP


4. For STP,
    - Configure C2 as the primary root bridge for vlan SECURITY, CCTV, and VOICE.
    - Configure C2 as the secondary root bridge for vlan ADMIN, HR, FINANCE.

Using the "show vlan brief" we can identify the specified VLANs.

@C2
conf t
 spanning-tree vlan 80,100,120 root primary
 spanning-tree vlan 5,10,40 root secondary
 end


5. Configure Uplinkfast for all Access switches.

@A1, A2, A3
conf t
 spanning-tree uplinkfast


6. Enable LLDP on D1, D2, and A3.

@D1, D2, A3
conf t
 lldp run


    - On the interface of both D1 & D2 that connects to A3, configure the interfaces to not send CDP packets, and only receive LLDP packets.

@D1, D2
conf t
 int e0/3
  no cdp enable
  no lldp transmit
  lldp receive


    - On both interface of A3 that is connected to D1 & D2, configure the interfaces to not send CDP packets, and send lldp packets but not receive.

@A3
conf t
 int range e0/1-2
  no cdp enable
  lldp transmit
  no lldp receive


Verification: Using the "show cdp neighbor" and "show lldp neighbor" command, A3 must no longer be able to discover D1 & D2, but D1 & D2 will be able to discover D3 only via LLDP.
