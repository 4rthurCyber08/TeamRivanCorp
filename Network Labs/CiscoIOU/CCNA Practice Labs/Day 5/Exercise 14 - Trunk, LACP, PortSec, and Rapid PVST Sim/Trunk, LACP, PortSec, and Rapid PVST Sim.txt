TASKS

Three switches must be configured for Layer 2 connectivity.
The company requires only the designated VLANs to be configured on their respective switches and permitted across any links between switches for security purposes.

Do not modify or delete VTP configurations.

The network needs two user-defined VLANs configured:

VLAN 60: ADMIN
VLAN 140: SEC


1. Configure the VLANs on the designated switches and assign them as access ports to the interfaces connected to the PCs.


2. Configure etherchannel on the links between access switches.
    - A1 & A2 must negotiate forming a LACP etherchannel.
    - A3 must not negotiate but will form a LACP ethercnannel.
    - Use the correct port-channel number as specified in the topology.


3. Configure all port-channels as 802.1q trunks with only the required VLANs permitted.


4. Configure security on the interface of the switches that are connected to the end devices.
    - Set the maximum number of secure MAC address to two on each interface.
    - Drop packets with unknown source address until the number of secure MAC addresses drops below the configured maximum value. Notification action is required on A1 & A2, while A3 is not required for any notification.
    - Allow secure MAC addresses to be learned dynamically.


5. Configure A1, A2, & A3 for RAPID PVST
    - Set the interfaces of the switches that are connected to end devices with portfast.

SOLUTION

1. Configure the VLANs on the designated switches and assign them as access ports to the interfaces connected to the PCs.

It is specified that the company requires only the designated VLANs to be configured on their respective switches.
This means that for A1, we only need to configure VLAN ADMIN.

On A2 & A3, we will need to configure both VLAN ADMIN & SEC. A2 needs to have both VLANs because it is needed to transmit packets for P1 and P3 to communicate.

@A1
conf t
 vlan 60 
  name ADMIN
 int e0/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 60

@A2
conf t
 vlan 60 
  name ADMIN
 vlan 140
  name SEC
 int e0/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 140

@A3
conf t
  vlan 60 
  name ADMIN
 vlan 140
  name SEC
 int e0/0
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 140
 int e0/3
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 60


2. Configure etherchannel on the links between access switches.
    - A1 & A2 must negotiate forming a LACP etherchannel.

Remember to use the "show cdp neighbor" command to identify connected ports.

@A1
conf t
 int range e0/1-2
  channel-group 12 mode active
  channel-protocol lacp

@A2
conf t
 int range e0/1,e1/0
  channel-group 12 mode active
  channel-protocol lacp
 int range e0/2-3
  channel-group 23 mode active
  channel-protocol lacp


    - A3 must not negotiate but will form a LACP ethercnannel.

@A3
conf t
 int range e0/1-2
  channel-group 23 mode passive
  channel-protocol lacp

    - Use the correct port-channel number as specified in the topology.

Verification: Access A2 and enter the "show etherchannel summary" command.
Port-channel 12 & 23 must be tagged with SU. (S - Layer 2) (U - In use)


3. Configure all port-channels as 802.1q trunks with only the required VLANs permitted.

@A1, A2
conf t
 int po12
  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  switchport mode trunk
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 60

@A2, A3
conf t
 int po23
  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  switchport mode trunk
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 60,140


4. Configure security on the interface of the switches that are connected to the end devices.
    - Set the maximum number of secure MAC address to two on each interface.
    - Drop packets with unknown source address until the number of secure MAC addresses drops below the configured maximum value. Notification action is required on A1 & A2, while A3 is not required for any notification.
    - Allow secure MAC addresses to be learned dynamically.

@A1, A2
conf t
 int e0/0
  switchport port-security
  switchport port-security maximum 2
  switchport port-security violation restrict
  switchport port-security mac-address sticky

@A3
conf t
 int e0/0
  switchport port-security
  switchport port-security maximum 2
  switchport port-security violation protect
  switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 int e0/3
  switchport port-security
  switchport port-security maximum 2
  switchport port-security violation protect
  switchport port-security mac-address sticky


5. Configure A1, A2, & A3 for RAPID PVST

@A1, A2, A3
conf t
 spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst


    - Set the interfaces of the switches that are connected to end devices with portfast.

@A1, A2, A3
conf t
 int e0/0
  spanning-tree portfast

@A3
conf t
 int e0/3
  spanning-tree portfast
