TASKS

Do not remove any BGP configurations

1. Configure NAT on R1, R2, R3, and R4 to allow PCs to ping the loopback IP of I1
	- Configure a standard ACL on R1 named r1nat, which allows only class A private IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r1pool using all the unused IP addresses of the network connected on R1's outside interface except for the one local to I1. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard ACL on R2 named r2nat, which allows only class B private IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r2pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R2's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard numbered ACL on R3 that allows class C private IP addresses to be translated using only the IP address on R3's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure an extended numbered ACL on R4 that allows only all private IP addresses to be translated on R4's e0/1 interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.


2. Configure I1 as a DNS server
	- Set R1's public IP as www.web11.com
	- Set R2's public IP as www.web12.com
	- Set R3's public IP as www.web13.com
	- Set R4's public IP as www.web14.com


3. Configure All routers and PCs to have I1 as their DNS Server


4. Configure an ACL on R3 named 'portnumz' to allow only the following:
	- HTTP, HTTPS, and Finger from R2
	- ICMP, NTP, Chargen, and DNS from R1
	- Telnet, SSH, and both Bootstrap Protocol from R4
	- Any ports higher than 4000 from P2


5. Configure the following accounts on P2 and make sure to enable only Telnet and SSH connections without the use of an ACL.
	- Username: adm1n
	  Password: s3cr3t
          Hash: Type 5

	- Username: n3t4ccess
	  Password: h1dden
	  Hash: Type 8

	- Username: rivan
	  Password: C1sc0123
	  Hash: Type 9

6. Configure R4 so that any telnet connections recieved on its ethernet 0/1 interface will be sent to P4.


7. Configure a Standard ACL named 'nologin' on R1 to deny remote connections from R2.
	- Do not use the transport input command to achieve this.

8. TShoot the ACL on R2 so that the address 20.20.20.20/24 can be pinged by R2. 


SOLUTION

1. Configure NAT on R1, R2, R3, and R4 to allow PCs to ping the loopback IP of I1
	- Configure a standard ACL on R1 named r1nat, which allows only class A private IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r1pool using all the unused IP addresses of the network connected on R1's outside interface except for the one local to I1. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

To configure NAT, we need to specify the inside and outside interfaces. 

@R1
conf t
 int e0/0
  ip nat outside
 int e0/1
  ip nat inside
  end

Next, we need to configure a named standard access-list that permits only Class A private ip addresses. 
We know that the private Class A ip range is, 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Since the network portion is only the first 8 bits, or the first octet (10.x.x.x) we can simply use a /8 or 0.255.255.255 wildcard mask for the access-list.

@R1
conf t
 ip access-list standard r1nat
  permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
  end

Now we need a NAT pool that contains the unused ip addresses on R1's outside interface except for the one local to I1, in this case is 4.213.11.130 - 4.213.11.254

@R1
conf t
 ip nat pool r1pool 4.213.11.130 4.213.11.254 netmask 255.255.255.128
 end

Now we are ready to apply the final configuration that will enable nat translations. Make sure to add the overload key word to allow multiple devices to use the same outside ip through the use of port mappings.

@R1
conf t
 ip nat inside source list r1nat pool r1pool overload
 end


	- Configure a standard ACL on R2 named r2nat, which allows only class B private IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r2pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R2's outside interface except for the one local to I1. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

@R2
conf t
 int e0/0
  ip nat outside
 int e0/1
  ip nat inside
  end

This time, we need to configure a named standard access-list, that permits only Class B private ip addresses. 
We know that the private Class B ip range is, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255

This time we need to think about what Wildcard Mask we need to use to capture all IPs within that range. 

Let's start by using CIDR. 

On the second octet, notice that the number (172.16.x.x) ranges up to (172.31.x.x). Do we know of a slash that increments in such a way? That increments by 16?

The slash is /12 with the rivan form at of (2nd octet, 16i)

Let's see if the range is correct.

172.0.0.0 /16 Network 1
172.0.0.1 First Valid
172.15.255.254 Last Valid
172.15.255.255 Broadcast

172.16.0.0 Network 2
172.16.0.1 First Valid
172.31.255.254 Last Valid
172.31.255.255 Broadcast

172.32.0.0 Network 3
and so on

Based on network 2, we can now specify class B addresses for the acl

@R2
conf t
 ip access-list standard r2nat
  permit 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255
  end

Now we need a NAT pool that contains the unused ip addresses on R2's outside interface except for the one local to I1, in this case is 19.211.163.34 - 19.211.163.62

@R2
conf t
 ip nat pool r2pool 19.211.163.34 19.211.163.62 netmask 255.255.255.224
 end

Now apply the final command with overload.

@R2
conf t
 ip nat inside source list r2nat pool r2pool overload
 end


	- Configure a standard numbered ACL on R3, that allows class C private IP addresses to be translated using only the IP address on R3's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

@R3
conf t
 int e0/1
  ip nat outside
 int e0/0
  ip nat inside
  end

Class C private IP addresses range from 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

Since the network portion is 192.168.0.0 we can simply use a /16 to specify the range.
Also, the number range for standard access-list is 1-99 and 1300-1999, while extended is 100-199 and 2000-2699.

@R3
conf t
 access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
 end

Now compared to the other tasks, we simply need to specify the outside interface of R3 to make use of its global ip address for translating inside local ips.

@R3
conf t
 ip nat inside source list 1 int e0/1 overload
 end


	- Configure an extended numbered ACL on R4 that allows only all private IP addresses to be translated on R4's e0/1 interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

@R4
conf t
 int e0/1
  ip nat outside
 int e0/0
  ip nat inside
  end

Once again the number range for standard access-list is 1-99 and 1300-1999, while extended is 100-199 and 2000-2699.

@R4
conf t
 access-list 100 permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any
 access-list 100 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 any
 access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
 end

Finally, input the command to configure nat using R4s outside interface.

@R4
conf t
 ip nat inside source list 100 int e0/1 overload
 end


2. Configure I1 as a DNS server
	- Set R1's public IP as www.web11.com
	- Set R2's public IP as www.web12.com
	- Set R3's public IP as www.web13.com
	- Set R4's public IP as www.web14.com

@I1
conf t
 ip dns server
 ip domain lookup
 ip host www.web11.com 4.213.11.254
 ip host www.web12.com 19.211.163.62
 ip host www.web13.com 72.6.12.22
 ip host www.web14.com 107.22.47.54
 end


3. Configure All routers and PCs to have I1 as their DNS Server

@All
conf t
 ip name-server 8.8.8.8
 end


4. Configure an ACL on R3 named 'portnumz' to allow only the following:
	- HTTP, HTTPS, and Finger coming from R2
	- ICMP, NTP, Chargen, and DNS coming from R1
	- Telnet, SSH, and both Bootstrap Protocol coming from R4
	- Any tcp ports higher than 4000 coming from P2

@R3
conf t
 ip access-list extended portnumz
  permit tcp 19.211.163.62 0.0.0.31 any eq 80
  permit tcp 19.211.163.62 0.0.0.31 any eq 443
  permit tcp 19.211.163.62 0.0.0.31 any eq 79
  !
  permit icmp 4.213.11.254 0.0.0.128 any
  permit udp 4.213.11.254 0.0.0.128 any eq 123
  permit tcp 4.213.11.254 0.0.0.128 any eq 19
  permit tcp 4.213.11.254 0.0.0.128 any eq 53
  !
  permit tcp 107.22.47.54 0.0.0.3 any eq 23
  permit tcp 107.22.47.54 0.0.0.3 any eq 22
  permit udp 107.22.47.54 0.0.0.3 any eq 67
  permit udp 107.22.47.54 0.0.0.3 any eq 68
  !
  permit tcp 19.211.163.62 0.0.0.31 any gt 4000
  end

5. Configure the following accounts on P2 and make sure to enable only Telnet and SSH connections without the use of an ACL.
	- Username: adm1n
	  Password: s3cr3t
          Hash: Type 5

	- Username: n3t4ccess
	  Password: h1dden
	  Hash: Type 8

	- Username: rivan
	  Password: C1sc0123
	  Hash: Type 9

6. Configure R4 so that any telnet connections recieved on its ethernet 0/1 interface will be sent to P4.


7. Configure a Standard ACL named 'nologin' on R1 to deny remote connections from R2.
	- Do not use the transport input command to achieve this.

8. TShoot the ACL on R2 so that the address 8.8.8.8 is able to ping R2.
