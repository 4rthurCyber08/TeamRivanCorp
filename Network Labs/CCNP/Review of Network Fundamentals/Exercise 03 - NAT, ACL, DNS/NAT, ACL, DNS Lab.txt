TASKS

Do not remove any BGP configurations

1. Configure NAT on R1, R2, R3, and R4 to allow PCs to ping the loopback IP of I1
	- Configure a standard ACL on R1 named r1nat, which allows only class A IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r1pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R1's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard ACL on R2 named r2nat, which allows only class B IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r2pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R2's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard ACL on R3 using a number as its identifier, that allows class C IP addresses to be translated using only the IP address on R3's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure an extended ACL on R4 using a number as its identifier, that allows only all private IP addresses to be translated on R4's e0/1 interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.


2. Configure I1 as a DNS server
	- Set R1's public IP as www.web11.com
	- Set R2's public IP as www.web12.com
	- Set R3's public IP as www.web13.com
	- Set R4's public IP as www.web14.com


3. Configure All routers and PCs to have I1 as their DNS Server


4. Configure an ACL on R3 named 'portnumz' to allow only the following:
	- HTTP, HTTPS, and Finger from R2
	- ICMP, NTP, Chargen, and DNS from R1
	- Telnet, SSH, and both Bootstrap Protocol from R4
	- Any ports higher than 4000 from P2


5. Configure the following accounts on P2 and make sure to enable only Telnet and SSH connections without the use of an ACL.
	- Username: adm1n
	  Password: s3cr3t
          Hash: Type 5

	- Username: n3t4ccess
	  Password: h1dden
	  Hash: Type 8

	- Username: rivan
	  Password: C1sc0123
	  Hash: Type 9

6. Configure R4 so that any telnet connections recieved on its ethernet 0/1 interface will be sent to P4.


7. Configure a Standard ACL named 'nologin' on R1 to deny remote connections from R2.
	- Do not use the transport input command to achieve this.

8. TShoot the ACL on R2 so that the address 20.20.20.20/24 can be pinged by R2. 


SOLUTION

1. Configure NAT on R1, R2, R3, and R4 to allow PCs to ping the loopback IP of I1
	- Configure a standard ACL on R1 named r1nat, which allows only class A IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r1pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R1's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard ACL on R2 named r2nat, which allows only class B IP addresses to be translated from a pool named r2pool using all the IP addresses of the network connected on R2's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure a standard ACL on R3 using a number as its identifier, that allows class C IP addresses to be translated using only the IP address on R3's outside interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.

	- Configure an extended ACL on R4 using a number as its identifier, that allows only all private IP addresses to be translated on R4's e0/1 interface. Multiple hosts must be able to use the same IP addresses.


2. Configure I1 as a DNS server
	- Set R1's public IP as www.web11.com
	- Set R2's public IP as www.web12.com
	- Set R3's public IP as www.web13.com
	- Set R4's public IP as www.web14.com


3. Configure All routers and PCs to have I1 as their DNS Server


4. Configure an ACL on R3 named 'portnumz' to allow only the following:
	- HTTP, HTTPS, and Finger from R2
	- ICMP, NTP, Chargen, and DNS from R1
	- Telnet, SSH, and both Bootstrap Protocol from R4
	- Any ports higher than 4000 from P2


5. Configure the following accounts on P2 and make sure to enable only Telnet and SSH connections without the use of an ACL.
	- Username: adm1n
	  Password: s3cr3t
          Hash: Type 5

	- Username: n3t4ccess
	  Password: h1dden
	  Hash: Type 8

	- Username: rivan
	  Password: C1sc0123
	  Hash: Type 9

6. Configure R4 so that any telnet connections recieved on its ethernet 0/1 interface will be sent to P4.


7. Configure a Standard ACL named 'nologin' on R1 to deny remote connections from R2.
	- Do not use the transport input command to achieve this.

8. TShoot the ACL on R2 so that the address 8.8.8.8 is able to ping R2.
