9. Configure P3 as a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client.
		
10. Configure a static IPv6 routes that will allow D3 and D1 to reach each other's loopback 0 address.
	- Do not use dynamic addressing.

11. Based on S1's IPv6 address, assign R1's e0/1 interface the last valid IPv6 address that is not a reserved anycast.




SOLUTION


1. Assign P1 and P2 to the correct VLAN.

Use the "show vlan brief" on D2 to check the VLAN ID of MAIN and SEC

@D2
show vlan brief

We find out that VLAN MAIN is 15 and VLAN SEC is 28.

@D2
conf t
 int e0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 15
 int e0/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 28
  end


2. Based on D1's IPv4 and IPv6 address,
	- Apply the last valid ipv4 address on D2's e0/0 interface.
	- Apply the last valid IPv6 address that is not a reserved anycast on D2's e0/0 interface.

For IPv4

	D1's IP: 10.1.1.65 /26
	/26 is (4th Octet, 64i)
	
	/26 increments in 64 therefore:
		1st Subnet = 10.1.1.0 /26
		2nd Subnet = 10.1.1.64 /26
		3rd Subnet = 10.1.1.128 /26

	10.1.1.65 belongs to the second subnet of /26 and is the first valid IP.
	
	Network: 10.1.1.64 /26
	First Valid (+1 to network): 10.1.1.65 /26
	Last Valid (-1 to broadcast): 10.1.1.126 /26
	Last IP/Broadcast (-1 to next network): 10.1.1.127 /26

	Next Network: 10.1.1.128 /26


For IPv6

	D1's IP: fc01:0:1:2::1 /64 
	/64 (4th field, 4th hex, 1i)
	
	/64 increments by 1 on the 4th hexadecimal on the 4th field.
	
	Expanded IPv6 address
	
		fc01 : 0000 : 0001 : 0002 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 0001 /64
	
		4th field is :0002:
		4th hex is 2
		
		If we break down the hexadecimal 2 in its binary form:
			
			2 = 0010
			
			Then we can determine the increment:
			
			8i	4i	2i	1i
			0	0	1	0
	
	Therefore,
		Network: fc01:0:1:2:: /64
		First Valid: fc01:0:1:2::1 /64
	
	The reserved anycast is the last 128 IP address of any /64 network.
	
		Last Valid (Not Anycast): fc01:0:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f /64
		Last IP/Anycast Range: fc01:0:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ff80 /64 - fc01:0:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff /64
		
@D2
conf t
 ipv6 unicast-routing
 int e0/0
  no switchport
  ip add 10.1.1.126 255.255.255.0
  ipv6 add fc01:0:1:2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ff7f/64
  no shut
  end
 
Verify:

@D2
ping 10.1.1.65
ping fc01:0:1:2::1


3. Configure D2 as a DHCPv4 Server for VLAN MAIN and VLAN SEC.
	- VLAN MAIN:
		+ Name the pool as mainpool
		+ Exclude the first 50 IPs
		+ Set the domain name to main.labs
		+ Set the gateway as D2
		+ Set S1 as the TFTP Server

Use the "show run" or "show run | inc interface | ip add" command on D1 and D2 to determine the network and IP of each VLAN on the respective switch.

@D2
show run | inc interface | ip add

We find out that,
	VLAN MAIN = 172.16.15.140 /25
	VLAN SEC = 192.168.28.174 /29

@D2
conf t
 ip dhcp excluded-address 172.16.15.129 172.16.15.179
 ip dhcp pool mainpool
  network 172.16.15.128 255.255.255.128
  default-router 172.16.15.140
  domain-name main.labs
  option 150 ip 10.1.22.5
  end
  
	- VLAN SEC
		+ Name the pool as secp2pool
		+ Reserve the IPv4 address, 192.168.28.172 /29, for P2.
		+ Set P2's e0/2 mac address as its client ID for IP reservation
		+ Set the domain name to sec.labs
		+ Set the gateway as D2
		+ Set the lease time to 5 days and 12hrs

First we need to set P2's mac address for DHCP reservation.
Use the "show interface" command on P2's e0/2 interface

@P2
show int e0/2

We find that its mac address is aabb.cc00.a220. We must set this as the client identifier of the device.

@P2
conf t
 int e0/2
  ip dhcp client client-id hex aabbcc00a220
  no shut
  end

Now we can setup DHCP for P2

@D2
conf t
 ip dhcp pool secp2pool
  client-identifier aabb.cc00.a220
  host 192.168.28.172 255.255.255.248
  default-router 192.168.28.174
  domain-name sec.labs
  lease 5 12
  end

4. Configure P1 and P2 as dhcp clients.

@P1
conf t
 int e0/1
  no shut
  ip add dhcp
  end

@P2
conf t
 int e0/2
  no shut
  ip add dhcp
  end
  

5. Configure an IPv6 address on R1's e0/0 interface using EUI-64 that will allow it to ping D3 via IPv6.

@R1
conf t
 ipv6 unicast-routing
 int e0/0
  ipv6 add fc01:0:1:3::/64 eui-64
  no shut
  end

Verify: Ping D3's IPv6 address.


5. Configure an IPv4 address on R1 that will allow it to reach D3's e0/0 interface.

Since D3's IP is a /30, this means there's only 2 valid IP addresses on this subnet.

10.1.2.5 /30 (4th Octet, 4i)

10.1.2.0 = 1st Subnet
10.1.2.4 = 2nd Subnet
10.1.2.8 = 3rd Subnet

Network: 10.1.2.4 /30
1st Valip: 10.1.2.5 /30
Last Valid: 10.1.2.6 /30
Last IP/Broadcast: 10.1.2.7 /30

Next Network: 10.1.2.8 /30

@R1
conf t
 int e0/0
  ip add 10.1.2.6 255.255.255.252
  no shut
  end

6. Configure R1 as the gateway for D3.

@D3
conf t
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.2.6
 end
 

7. Configure D3 as a DHCPv4 and Stateful DHCPv6 server for P3.
	- IPv4
		+ The network must be of the same subnet as R1's e0/2 interface
		+ Reserve the first 100 IPs of the subnet.
		+ Set R1 as the gateway
		+ Set the domain name as ccnp.com

First, use the "show ip interface brief" or "show run | inc interface | ip add" command on R1 to identify the IP on its e0/2 interface.

@R1
show ip interface brief

We find out that R1's e0/2 address is 172.16.41.1 /22

@D3
conf t
 ip dhcp excluded-address 172.16.40.1 172.16.40.100
 !- no name was specified for the dhcp pool, so we specify one ourselves
 ip dhcp pool mypool
  network 172.16.40.0 255.255.252.0
  default-router 172.16.41.1
  domain-name ccnp.com
  end

	- IPv6
		+ Set S1 as its DNS Server
		+ The prefix must be based on R1's IPv6 address on its e0/2

Use the command "show run" or "show run | inc int | ipv6" to determine the ipv6 address of R1's e0/2 interface.

@D3
conf t
 ipv6 dhcp pool mypoolv6
  address prefix fd13:1:3::/78
  dns-server fc02::1:1
  exit
 int e0/0
  ipv6 dhcp server mypoolv6
  ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
  ipv6 nd prefix fd13:1:3::/78 no-autoconfig
  end


8. Configure R1 for DHCP Relay to allow P3 to obtain an IPv4 and IPv6 address.

@R1
conf t
 int e0/2
  ip helper-address 10.1.2.5
  ipv6 dhcp relay destination fc01:0:1:3::1
  end

9. Configure P3 as a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client.
		
@P3
conf t
 int e0/3
  no shut
  ip add dhcp
  ipv6 enable
  ipv6 address dhcp
  end
  
  
10. Configure a static IPv6 routes that will allow D3 and D1 to reach each other's loopback 0 address.
	- Do not use dynamic addressing.

Since we are limited to static routing, we'll need to make sure every device between D3 and D1 knows how to reach both loopbacks. 
Then we can resort to a default route on D1 and D3.

First we need to know the IP address of the loopback of each device.

@D1, D3
sh ipv6 int br

We find out that
D1 Lo0 = FD33:0:1::1aa1 /64
D3 Lo0 = FD33:0:3::3cc3 /64

Also, make sure to determine the next-hop that will be used for each static route.

@R1
conf t
 ipv6 route FD33:0:1::/64 2001:DB8::1
 ipv6 route FD33:0:3::/64 FC01:0:1:3::1
 end

@D2
conf t
 ipv6 route FD33:0:1::/64 FC01:0:1:2::1
 ipv6 route FD33:0:3::/64 2001:DB8::2
 end

@D1
conf t
 ipv6 route ::/0 FC01:0:1:2:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FF7F
 end


*NOTE D3 Static route will be different for you because of the EUI-64 config.

@D3
conf t
 ipv6 route ::/0 FC01:0:1:3:A8BB:CCFF:FE00:A000
 !
 !- NOTE
 !- FC01:0:1:3:A8BB:CCFF:FE00:A000 is an IP on R1's e0/0 int
 !- since we configured it via EUI-64, your R1 IP will be different
 end

11. Based on S1's IPv6 address, assign R1's e0/1 interface the last valid IPv6 address that is not a reserved anycast.

@R1
conf t
 int e0/1
  ipv6 add fc02::1:7f/120
  end
