TASKS

D1, I1, and I2 is inaccessible. 

1. Configure LACP etherchannel on the link between D1 and D2.
 - D1 is negotiating to be a LACP etherchannel.
 - The mode on D1 and D2 must be different.

2. Configure default routes on R1 to reach the IP 8.8.8.8
 - Set a default route on R1's e0/2 interface to reach 8.8.8.8
 - Set a floating static default route on R1's e0/3 interface to reach 8.8.8.8 with an administrative distance 50 units higher than EIGRP.

3. Configure a static host route on R2 to reach only the IP 8.8.8.8

4. Establish IP connectivity between S1 and R2 using only static host routes.

5. Establish redundant IP connectivity between D2 and S1 using only static network routes. 
 - D2 must prefer D1 to reach S1
 - R2 must serve as backup to reach S1.

6. Configure a default route on R1 to reach S1 and I3
